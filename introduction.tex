%INTRODUCTION: deve responder a "WHAT?" e a "WHY?"

This report describes the work developed under the project "Wireless IoT Architecture for Smart Nodes deployed in Hospital Beds", which took place in the Institute of Systems and Robotics (ISR) in Coimbra in the past year. 

\section{Context}

\todo[inline]{To-do:
Steady increase of population lifespan introduces many challenges to healthcare systems (more elderly people, chronic diseases become more common, thus greater pressure on these systems, bigger healthcare costs, ...);

What has digital health done to help this?

concepts: IoT, digital health...}

\section{Objectives}
\todo[inline]{To-do: Discuss if this section should move to AFTER literature review

 "Based on our previous experiences in bringing digital heath solutions to the European hospitals (see for instance the swithome project), hospitals are more likely to accept a solution, if it is already connected to their hospital information system."
 The system should be non-invasive, reliable and satisfy the stringent security and privacy requirements of health information systems
}

\section{Requirement Analysis}

\todo[inline]{To-do: Brief overview of system requirements, but these will be later described in the next section. }

\section{Thesis Structure}

\todo[inline]{To-do: Apresentar e explicar a estrutura / organização da tese
"dizer como vamos responder a "HOW?" na restante dissertação."}
