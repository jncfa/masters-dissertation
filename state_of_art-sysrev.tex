% This chapter presents a survey of patrolling, surveillance, navigation and exploration strategies already implemented in the literature. In the last decades, related algorithms for multiple robot teams have piqued the interest of the robotics community, becoming a remarkable growing area. One of the main reasons contributing to this fact is the variety of approaches that these algorithms can comprise. Many authors contributed with studies that involve many different strategies to solve these problems. In this section, some of the background work related to different strategies is presented. The reader will note that it is not imperative to follow just one of these strategies. In fact, most of them result from mixed strategies, though more evident characteristics related to the strategy being discussed are focused in each section.

In \cite{Fuhrer2006}, one of the first \acs{IoT} applications for healthcare is described. The authors propose a real-time locating system (RTLS) using \acs{RFID} tags called RFIDLocator. These tags are placed in hospital equipment, staff, patients and medical files and using \acs{RFID} readers placed in strategic locations around the hospital (\textit{e.g.} entrance of rooms, handheld readers), it is possible to track the location of each object. When a \acs{RFID} reader detects a \acs{RFID} tag it communicates this information, using Wi-Fi, to a central server which stores it in a MySQL database. Healthcare workers can then view this information through a web application, which contains a location history of the tagged object. The authors show how RTLS systems can mitigate the risks of patient misidentification, loss or theft of assets and even drug counterfeiting. However, in this article, security and privacy issues are not discussed. Although not stated explicitly, communications between the RFID tags and the RFID readers are assumed to be unencrypted, which means ``unethical individuals could snoop on people and surreptitiously collect data (...) without their knowledge'', even after leaving the hospital if the tags are not removed. This raises serious privacy concerns, as the tags could contain private information that can be detrimental to the patients if revealed.

In \cite{Adame2018}, the authors propose a RTLS system that also monitors the patient's vital signs, using a small wristband which holds a low power device equipped with temperature, photoplethysmography (PPG), used to obtain the heart rate, and accelerometer sensors, used for detecting fall events. The system can also detect with 70\% accuracy if the patient has fallen, sending an immediate message to the gateway, which will later alert the clinical staff of the emergency. The authors ran a pilot test within hospital premises which was well-received by the clinical staff who praised the system for its intuitiveness and non-intrusiveness, stating that it could be easily integrated with their current \acs{HIS}. However, the authors pointed out some issues with the usage of \acs{RFID} tags with sensors for patient monitoring. The \acs{RFID} reader needs to provide power to the \acs{RFID} tags, and when using these tags with sensors, the readers could not provide enough power by default, . Regarding e-health standards, the authors did not discuss any protocols for exchanging data such as \acs{FHIR}, which can undermine the integration of the system with existing \acs{HIS}s.

%Future Work:
%"Since security is not the focus of this article, the two common security measures are implemented to meet the basic requirements of the following: (...) Security Between Wearable Patches and Gateways (...) Security Measures in Gateways and Cloud Server"
%"In our future work, more edge computing functions on the gateway will be developed for an IoT-connected healthcare platform."

Wu et al. \cite{Wu2020} develop a system which uses wearable sensor patches to monitor the patients' status. The wearable sensors transmit the different physiological signals (ECG, PPG and body temperature) to gateways using \acs{BLE}, which can either by fixed (using a Raspberry Pi module) or mobile (using a smartphone). The gateway exchanges data with the cloud through bridged \acs{MQTT} brokers, after which it is stored in a MySQL database. The data is stored both in the cloud server and in the fixed gateway. The local users can interact with the system through a web based user interface (UI) using the smartphone or other web browsers in the local area network. However, the usage of local data storage can cause data integrity issues as the system must ensure databases in both the server and gateways are synchronized at all times. This can undermine the scalability of the system, as the redundant data synchronization can become a performance bottleneck. Moreover, the Raspberry Pi platform does not support full disk encryption \cite{}. By redundantly storing the data in gateway, the data is in risk of exposure to malicious third parties.

In \cite{Doukas2012}, the authors proposed a \acs{IoT} infrastructure that acquires real-time patient data from wearable sensors, using a cloud platform to handle all data processing and storage requirements. The wearable device takes the form of a sock, designated ``CloudSensorSock'', which holds the different sensors. The CloudSensorSock acquires mobile data, through accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, vital data, through temperature and heartbeat sensors, and contextual information about the patient's environment using air quality ($CO_2$) sensors. The authors propose that the data processing fully occurs in the cloud server as cloud platforms can scale to the needs of the application. However, this is not viable for time critical applications. As discussed earlier, the latency in the communications between devices and a remote server may be (...)
