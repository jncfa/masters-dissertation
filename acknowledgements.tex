\todo[inline]{To-do: Add acknowledgements text.} 

During these last years, several people have been paramount for the conclusion of this thesis, and as such, I would like to acknowledge all of those who helped me in some way or another to achieve this.

First and foremost, I want to thank my family, who supported and helped me throughout all these years. 

I also extend my deepest gratitude to my supervisors, Prof. Mahmoud Tavakoli and in particular Dr. David Portugal, for his guidance, his continuous support and for giving me an opportunity to undertake this challenge and so much more.
