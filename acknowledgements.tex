During these last years, several people have been paramount for the conclusion of this thesis, and as such, I would like to acknowledge all of those who helped me in some way or another to achieve this.

First and foremost, I want to thank my family, for their love and care, who supported and helped me throughout all these years, and without whom I would never be able to continuously push forward. 

I also wish to extend my deepest gratitude to my supervisors, Prof. Mahmoud Tavakoli and in particular Dr. David Portugal, for his guidance, his continuous support, and for giving me an opportunity to undertake this challenge and so much more; I will be forever grateful.

Finally, to my closest friends, Edgar, Id√°lio, Daniel, Afonso, Gabriel and Brito for putting up with me all of this time, which I know to be a very troublesome task at times, and being a helping hand on this journey, thank you.
