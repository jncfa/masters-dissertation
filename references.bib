abstract = {Originated from Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have been applied to numerous domains. However, after an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art, several factors have been found to limit the development of applications based on BSNs. In this paper we introduce the concept of Open BSNs for improving the development of BSNs. Specifically, open BSNs can improve key aspects such as energy efficiency, system interoperability, system usability and scalability, and privacy support. Application scenarios and future research challenges of Open BSNs are also presented.},

abstract = {Among the panoply of applications enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), smart and connected health care is a particularly important one. Networked sensors, either worn on the body or embedded in our living environments, make possible the gathering of rich information indicative of our physical and mental health. Captured on a continual basis, aggregated, and effectively mined, such information can bring about a positive transformative change in the health care landscape. In particular, the availability of data at hitherto unimagined scales and temporal longitudes coupled with a new generation of intelligent processing algorithms can: (a) facilitate an evolution in the practice of medicine, from the current post facto diagnose-and-treat reactive paradigm, to a proactive framework for prognosis of diseases at an incipient stage, coupled with prevention, cure, and overall management of health instead of disease, (b) enable personalization of treatment and management options targeted particularly to the specific circumstances and needs of the individual, and (c) help reduce the cost of health care while simultaneously improving outcomes. In this paper, we highlight the opportunities and challenges for IoT in realizing this vision of the future of health care.},

abstract = {This paper is intended to guide developers of wireless systems who are puzzled by the vast number of radio configuration parameters and options. We provide experimental data comparing power consumption of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), ZigBee and ANT protocols for a cyclic sleep scenario, in which a short-range and low-power wireless sensor node periodically sends a data packet to a remote ‘hub' with intervening sleep intervals. Devices such as wearable health monitors often use this scenario to interface with a mobile phone-based hub. For all measured sleep intervals BLE achieved lower power consumption (10.1 uA, at 120 s interval), compared with ZigBee (15.7 uA), and ANT (28.2 uA). Power consumption differences can be attributed to the time taken for a node to connect to the hub after waking up and the use of sleep between individual RF packets. For the three protocols we determined a sleep interval at which the trade-off between power consumption and data rate is optimized.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has been identified in various applications across different domains, such as in the healthcare sector. IoT has also been recognised for its revolution in reshaping modern healthcare with aspiring wide range prospects, including economical, technological and social. This study aims to establish IoT-based smart home security solutions for real-time health monitoring technologies in telemedicine architecture. A multilayer taxonomy is driven and conducted in this study. In the first layer, a comprehensive analysis on telemedicine, which focuses on the client and server sides, shows that other studies associated with IoT-based smart home applications have several limitations that remain unaddressed. Particularly, remote patient monitoring in healthcare applications presents various facilities and benefits by adopting IoT-based smart home technologies without compromising the security requirements and potentially large number of risks. An extensive search is conducted to identify articles that handle these issues, related applications are comprehensively reviewed and a coherent taxonomy for these articles is established. A total number of (n = 3064) are gathered between 2007 and 2017 for most reliable databases, such as ScienceDirect, Web of Science and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineer Xplore databases. Then, the articles based on IoT studies that are associated with telemedicine applications are filtered. Nine articles are selected and classified into two categories. The first category, which accounts for 22.22{\%} (n = 2/9), includes surveys on telemedicine articles and their applications. The second category, which accounts for 77.78{\%} (n = 7/9), includes articles on the client and server sides of telemedicine architecture. The collected studies reveal the essential requirement in constructing another taxonomy layer and review IoT-based smart home security studies. Therefore, IoT-based smart home security features are introduced and analysed in the second layer. The security of smart home design based on IoT applications is an aspect that represents a crucial matter for general occupants of smart homes, in which studies are required to provide a better solution with patient security, privacy protection and security of users' entities from being stolen or compromised. Innovative technologies have dispersed limitations related to this matter. The existing gaps and trends in this area should be investigated to provide valuable visions for technical environments and researchers. Thus, 67 articles are obtained in the second layer of our taxonomy and are classified into six categories. In the first category, 25.37{\%} (n = 17/67) of the articles focus on architecture design. In the second category, 17.91{\%} (n = 12/67) includes security analysis articles that investigate the research status in the security area of IoT-based smart home applications. In the third category, 10.44{\%} (n = 7/67) includes articles about security schemes. In the fourth category, 17.91{\%} (n = 12/67) comprises security examination. In the fifth category, 13.43{\%} (n = 9/67) analyses security protocols. In the final category, 14.92{\%} (n = 10/67) analyses the security framework. Then, the identified basic characteristics of this emerging field are presented and provided in the following aspects. Open challenges experienced on the development of IoT-based smart home security are addressed to be adopted fully in telemedicine applications. Then, the requirements are provided to increase researcher's interest in this study area. On this basis, a number of recommendations for different parties are described to provide insights on the next steps that should be considered to enhance the security of smart homes based on IoT. A map matching for both taxonomies is developed in this study to determine the novel risks and benefits of IoT-based smart home security for real-time remote health monitoring within client and server sides in telemedicine applications.},

abstract = {With technological advancements, the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a significant method to achieve remote healthcare monitoring, where secure and efficient medical data retrieval is crucial. However, IoT devices have limited resources, so it is hard to achieve secure and efficient medical data acquisition. Edge devices in an edge cloud can offer abundant resources, whereas the Named Data Networking (NDN) can improve data retrieval efficiency. Therefore, we are motivated to combine IoT with Edge cloud (IE) and exploit NDN to achieve IE-based medical data retrieval. Inspired by the idea, we propose a secure healthcare monitoring framework integrating NDN-based IoT with edge cloud. This framework exploits the advantages of NDN to improve efficiency of medical data retrieval, and employs ciphertext and signature to support security of medical data delivery. The framework is evaluated quantitatively. According to the data results, the framework reduces the medical data retrieval latency and cost by nearly 28{\%} and 52{\%} compared with the existing solution, respectively.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) research which has the capability to encapsulate identification potential and sensing capabilities, strives toward the objective of developing seamless, interoperable, and securely integrated systems which can be achieved by connecting the Internet with computing devices. This gives way for the evolution of wireless energy harvesting (EH) and power transmission using computing devices. Radio frequency (RF) based energy management (EM) has become the backbone for providing energy to wireless integrated systems. The two main techniques for EM in RF identification sensor networks (RSN) are EH and energy transfer (ET). These techniques enable the dynamic energy level maintenance and optimization as well as ensuring reliable communication which adheres to the goal of increased network performance and lifetime. In this paper, we present an overview of RSN, its types of integration and relative applications. We then provide the state-of-the-art EM techniques and strategies for RSN from August 2009 till date, thereby reviewing the existing EH and ET mechanisms designed for RSN. The taxonomy on various challenges for EM in RSN has also been articulated for open research directives.},

abstract = {Wearable medical devices with sensor continuously generate enormous data which is often called as big data mixed with structured and unstructured data. Due to the complexity of the data, it is difficult to process and analyze the big data for finding valuable information that can be useful in decision-making. On the other hand, data security is a key requirement in healthcare big data system. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new architecture for the implementation of IoT to store and process scalable sensor data (big data) for health care applications. The Proposed architecture consists of two main sub architectures, namely, Meta Fog-Redirection (MF-R) and Grouping and Choosing (GC) architecture. MF-R architecture uses big data technologies such as Apache Pig and Apache HBase for collection and storage of the sensor data (big data) generated from different sensor devices. The proposed GC architecture is used for securing integration of fog computing with cloud computing. This architecture also uses key management service and data categorization function (Sensitive, Critical and Normal) for providing security services. The framework also uses MapReduce based prediction model to predict the heart diseases. Performance evaluation parameters such as throughput, sensitivity, accuracy, and f-measure are calculated to prove the efficiency of the proposed architecture as well as the prediction model.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, the convincing forward steps in the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabling solutions are spurring the advent of novel and fascinating applications. Among others, mainly radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor network (WSN), and smart mobile technologies are leading this evolutionary trend. In the wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service. The simple proof of concept implemented to validate the proposed SHS has highlighted a number of key capabilities and aspects of novelty, which represent a significant step forward compared to the actual state of the art.},

Design and methods: This was an observational descriptive research study conducted in the adult intensive care unit of a university hospital in the Mediterranean region of Turkey. The nonparticipant observation method was used. Data were collected by two observers using a semi-structured observation form developed according to literature. Results: Between August 2016 and January 2017, 13 registered nurses were observed for 328 hours. There were 1781 alarms, which included alarms for blood pressure (37.6{\%}), respiration and oxygen saturation (35.3{\%}) and heart rate and arrhythmia (27.1{\%}). Nurses responded to approximately half (46.9{\%}) of the alarms that required a response. Responses to alarms included silencing them, responding to the patient's clinical condition and solving contact and transmission problems. Conclusion: In the present study, according to response requirement, the division of the alarms was different. The number of alarms that do not reflect the clinical status of the patient was high. It was found that as the false alarm rate increased, the response rate of nurses to these alarms decreased.},

abstract = {This paper presents the implementation details of a patient status awareness enabling human activity interpretation and emergency detection in cases, where the personal health is threatened like elder falls or patient collapses. The proposed system utilizes video, audio, and motion data captured from the patient's body using appropriate body sensors and the surrounding environment, using overhead cameras and microphone arrays. Appropriate tracking techniques are applied to the visual perceptual component enabling the trajectory tracking of persons, while proper audio data processing and sound directionality analysis in conjunction to motion information and subject's visual location can verify fall and indicate an emergency event. The postfall visual and motion behavior of the subject, which indicates the severity of the fall (e.g., if the person remains unconscious or patient recovers) is performed through a semantic representation of the patient's status, context and rules-based evaluation, and advanced classification. A number of advanced classification techniques have been examined in the framework of this study and their corresponding performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency in detecting an emergency situation has been thoroughly assessed. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {Effective decision-making to improve healthcare for people depends essentially upon availability of reliable health data. Several developing countries have maternal health indicators lagging behind as compared to international targets set by the UN as Millennium or Sustainable Development Goals. One of the major reasons is poor and non-standardized maternal health record keeping that affect data quality and undermines evidence-based decision making. The aim of this research is the design and development of HL7 FHIR compliant data access model for maintaining maternal health data as FHIR resources to enable effective exchange of health data. The proposed model is implemented as restful web services and data is stored in a NoSQL database for flexibility. To evaluate effectiveness, the system was reviewed by healthcare providers and expectant women. Their feedback highlights the usefulness of the proposed system as compared to traditional record keeping techniques. It is anticipated that the proposed system will lay the foundation of a comprehensive maternal healthcare information system. This shall enable trend analysis for policy-making to help accelerate the efforts for meeting global maternal health targets.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) offers a seamless platform to connect people and objects to one another for enriching and making our lives easier. This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.},

abstract = {People worldwide are getting older and this fact has pushed the need for designing new, more pervasive, and possibly cost effective healthcare systems. In this field, distributed and networked embedded systems, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), are the most appealing technology to achieve continuous monitoring of aged people for their own safety, without affecting their daily activities. This paper proposes recent advancements in this field by introducing WSN4QoL, a Marie Curie project which involves academic and industrial partners from three EU countries. The project aims to propose new WSN-based technologies to meet the specific requirements of pervasive healthcare applications. In particular, in this paper, the system architecture is presented to cope with the challenges imposed by the specific application scenario. This includes a network coding (NC) mechanism and a distributed localization solution that have been implemented on WSN testbeds to achieve efficiency in the communications and to enable indoor people tracking. Preliminary results in a real environment show good system performance that meet our expectations. {\textcopyright}2014 S. Tennina et al.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The online telemedicine systems are helpful since they provide timely and effective healthcare services. Such online healthcare systems are usually based on sophisticated and advanced wearable and wireless sensor technologies. A rapid technological growth has improved the scope of many remote health monitoring systems. Here, the researchers employed a cloud-based remote monitoring system for observing the health status of the patients after monitoring their heart rate variability. This system was developed after considering many factors like the ease of application, costs, accuracy, and the data security. Furthermore, this system was also conceptualized to act as an interface between the patients and the healthcare providers, thus ensuring a two-way communication between them. The major aim of this paper was to provide the best healthcare monitoring services to the people living in the remote areas, which was otherwise very difficult owing to the small doctor-to-patient ratio. The researchers also analyzed their monitoring system using two different databases. First comes from MIT Physionet database i.e., the MIT-BIH sinus rhythm and the MIT-St. Petersburg. While the second database was collected after monitoring 30 people who were asked to use these wearable sensors. After analyzing the performance of the proposed scheme, the obtained results for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 99.02{\%}, 98.78{\%}, and 99.17{\%}, respectively. The achieved results concluded that the proposed system was quite reliable, robust, and valuable. Also, the data analysis revealed that this system was very convenient and ensured data security. In addition, this developed monitoring system generated warning messages, directed towards the patients and the doctors, during some critical situation.},

abstract = {Continuous monitoring of an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices is becoming a norm these days with a large number of wearable kits becoming easily available. Modern wearable health monitoring devices have become easily available in the consumer market, however, real-Time analyses and prediction along with alerts and alarms about a health hazard are not adequately addressed in such devices. Taking ECG monitoring as a case study the research paper focusses on signal processing, arrhythmia detection and classification and at the same time focusses on updating the electronic health records database in realtime such that the concerned medical practitioners become aware of an emergent situation the patient being monitored might face. Also, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is usually considered as a basis for arrhythmia classification which largely depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the biopotential measurements of the ECG kits, so it may not yield accurate results. Initially, the ECG readings from the 3-Lead ECG analog front-end were de-noised, zero-offset corrected, filtered using recursive least square adaptive filter and smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter and subsequently passed to the data analysis component with a unique feature extraction method to increase the accuracy of classification. The machine learning models trained on MITDB arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH Physionet) showed more than 97{\%} accuracy using kNN classifiers. Neuralnet fitting models showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. ECG abnormalities based on annotations in MITDB could be classified and these ECG observations could be logged to a server implementation based on FHIR standards. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and ECG event observations were coded according to SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions. The system emphasizes on 'preventive care rather than remedial cure' as the next generation personalized health-care monitoring devices become available.},

abstract = {The development of electronic health records, wearable devices, health applications and Internet of Things (IoT)-empowered smart homes is promoting various applications. It also makes health self-management much more feasible, which can partially mitigate one of the challenges that the current healthcare system is facing. Effective and convenient self-management of health requires the collaborative use of health data and home environment data from different services, devices, and even open data on the Web. Although health data interoperability standards including HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and IoT ontology including Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) have been developed and promoted, it is impossible for all the different categories of services to adopt the same standard in the near future. This study presents a method that applies Semantic Web technologies to integrate the health data and home environment data from heterogeneously built services and devices. We propose a Web Ontology Language (OWL)-based integration ontology that models health data from HL7 FHIR standard implemented services, normal Web services and Web of Things (WoT) services and Linked Data together with home environment data from formal ontology-described WoT services. It works on the resource integration layer of the layered integration architecture. An example use case with a prototype implementation shows that the proposed method successfully integrates the health data and home environment data into a resource graph. The integrated data are annotated with semantics and ontological links, which make them machine-understandable and cross-system reusable.},

abstract = {According to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal No. 3 (SDG – Goal 3), for sustainable development it is imperative to ensure health and well-being across all ages, and is achievable only through effective and continuous healthcare monitoring. But in India and other third world countries, healthcare monitoring is poor compared to other countries in the world, in spite of it being affordable. The global healthcare smart wearable healthcare (SWH) devices market is expected to rise up at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 5.6{\%} and by 2020 it is expected to reach 25 Billion (GVR Report, 2016). The growing incidences of lifestyle diseases, sedentary lifestyle, busy work schedules, technological advancements in healthcare monitoring devices, and increased usage of remote devicesseems to be some of the important factors fuelling this growth. Some of the major players in this segment are Abbott Laboratories, Philips Healthcare, Life Watch, GE Healthcare, Omron Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare and Honeywell International Inc. etc. But in spite of the healthcare monitoring devices are being predicted to be technologically innovative and providing advanced as well as basic health care monitoring features and available in various price ranges based on the features, we wanted to empirically study the attitude towards adoption of such devices in India. India has traditionally been having a very lackadaisical attitude towards healthcare monitoring. In such a context, what would be the factors influencing the adoption of SWH devices. Remote health monitoring can enhance the nature of wellbeing administration and to lessen the aggregate expense in human services by maintaining a strategic distance from pointless hospitalizations and guaranteeing that the individuals who need critical consideration get it sooner. This empirical investigation would provide a detailed insight as to how these wearable Internet Of Things devices would bring about a revolution in the healthcare industry. It would also provide the future prospect of IOT devices in this sector and how the probability of increase in its usage can be increased with time. The paper explores intrusiveness (INTR), Comfort (C), perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (EOU) of SWH devices. The study hypothesized the Impact of PU and EOU, INTR and C on attitude and intention to use towards adoption of SWH devices. Partial Least Square Structured Equation Modeling (PLS – SEM) methodology was applied to explore the relationships between the concepts and hypothesis. The data was collected from 273 respondents. The age group of the respondents was between 25 and 40 years. The results indicated that intrusiveness and comfort do not have a significant direct impact on Intention to use BI (Behavior Intention) BI SWH devices. At the same time Intrusiveness had a significant impact on PU of SWH devices and Comfort has a strong significant impact on PU and EOU of smart wearables. The research has strong implications in the current emerging context of smart wearables, their design and effectiveness. Also the research can have lasting implications on elderly health and well-being. There are very few empirical studies in the area of SWH devices. Most of the studies till now are conceptual studies or providing technology architectures and frameworks. The research in this area is still at a very nascent stage and very few studies have been done to explore the use and adoption of SWH devices.},

IoT generates an unprecedented amount of data that can be processed using cloud computing. But for real-time remote health monitoring applications, the delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and back to the application is unacceptable. Relative to this context, we proposed the remote patient health monitoring in smart homes by using the concept of fog computing at the smart gateway. The proposed model uses advanced techniques and services, such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification services at the edge of the network. Event triggering-based data transmission methodology is adopted to process the patient's real-time data at fog layer. Temporal mining concept is used to analyze the events adversity by calculating the temporal health index of the patient. In order to determine the validity of the system, health data of 67 patients in IoT-based smart home environment was systematically generated for 30 days. Results depict that the proposed Bayesian belief network classifier-based model has high accuracy and response time in determining the state of an event when compared with other classification algorithms. Moreover, decision making based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.},

abstract = {Nowadays, a combination between Internet of Things (IoT) technology and remote healthcare system is extensively researched due to its efficiency and convenience for human life. When the number of IoT devices in health care system is increased exponentially, the privacy and security issues of patients are becoming a concern. In order to protect personal and device-generated information, we propose to use blockchain-based smart contracts for managing patients' information and medical devices. In detail, using blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol, we create a remote healthcare system including healthcare provider (such as hospital), healthcare professionals (doctors) and patients. Health condition of patients is measured by sensors and such information is written into blockchain automatically. In addition, we propose a processing mechanism to store the medical device information efficiently and sparingly in accordance with health situation of patient. Concretely, we filter the data from sensors before deciding whether to write data into blockchain or not. Doing so we can reduce the size of blockchain as well as save amount of coins for transaction efficiently. However, the abnormal data from sensors will be written to blockchain immediately and trigger an emergency contact to doctor and hospital for on-time treatment. We have verified the proposed smart contract on Ethereum test environment called TESTRPC and implemented the system on an experimental environment with real devices. This system works well at small scale.},

abstract = {Wearable sensors and social networking platforms play a key role in providing a new method to collect patient data for efficient healthcare monitoring. However, continuous patient monitoring using wearable sensors generates a large amount of healthcare data. In addition, the user-generated healthcare data on social networking sites come in large volumes and are unstructured. The existing healthcare monitoring systems are not efficient at extracting valuable information from sensors and social networking data, and they have difficulty analyzing it effectively. On top of that, the traditional machine learning approaches are not enough to process healthcare big data for abnormality prediction. Therefore, a novel healthcare monitoring framework based on the cloud environment and a big data analytics engine is proposed to precisely store and analyze healthcare data, and to improve the classification accuracy. The proposed big data analytics engine is based on data mining techniques, ontologies, and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). Data mining techniques efficiently preprocess the healthcare data and reduce the dimensionality of the data. The proposed ontologies provide semantic knowledge about entities and aspects, and their relations in the domains of diabetes and blood pressure (BP). Bi-LSTM correctly classifies the healthcare data to predict drug side effects and abnormal conditions in patients. Also, the proposed system classifies the patients' health condition using their healthcare data related to diabetes, BP, mental health, and drug reviews. This framework is developed employing the Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} Web Ontology Language tool with Java. The results show that the proposed model precisely handles heterogeneous data and improves the accuracy of health condition classification and drug side effect predictions.},

abstract = {Mapping and navigating with mobile robots in scenarios with reduced visibility, e.g. due to smoke, dust, or fog, is still a big challenge nowadays. In spite of the tremendous advance on Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques for the past decade, most of current algorithms fail in those environments because they usually rely on optical sensors providing dense range data, e.g. laser range finders, stereo vision, LIDARs, RGB-D, etc., whose measurement process is highly disturbed by particles of smoke, dust, or steam. This article addresses the problem of performing SLAM under reduced visibility conditions by proposing a sensor fusion layer which takes advantage from complementary characteristics between a laser range finder (LRF) and an array of sonars. This sensor fusion layer is ultimately used with a state-of-the-art SLAM technique to be resilient in scenarios where visibility cannot be assumed at all times. Special attention is given to mapping using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors, namely arrays of sonars which, being usually available in robotic platforms, raise technical issues that were investigated in the course of this work. Two sensor fusion methods, a heuristic method and a fuzzy logic-based method, are presented and discussed, corresponding to different stages of the research work conducted. The experimental validation of both methods with two different mobile robot platforms in smoky indoor scenarios showed that they provide a robust solution, using only COTS sensors, for adequately coping with reduced visibility in the SLAM process, thus decreasing significantly its impact in the mapping and localization results obtained.},

abstract = {Purpose: For patients with time-critical acute coronary syndrome, reporting electrocardiogram (ECG) findings is the most important component of the treatment process. We aimed to develop and validate an automated Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)-based 12-lead ECG mobile alert system for use in an emergency department (ED). Materials and Methods: An automated FHIR-based 12-lead ECG alert system was developed in the ED of an academic tertiary care hospital. The system was aimed at generating an alert for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome based on interpretation by the legacy device. The alert is transmitted to physicians both via a mobile application and the patient's electronic medical record (EMR). The automated FHIR-based 12-lead ECG alert system processing interval was defined as the time from ED arrival and 12-lead ECG capture to the time when the FHIR-based notification was transmitted. Results: During the study period, 3812 emergency visits and 1581 12-lead ECGs were recorded. The FHIR system generated 155 alerts for 116 patients. The alerted patients were significantly older [mean (standard deviation): 68.1 (12.4) years vs. 59.6 (16.8) years, p{\textless}0.001], and the cardiac-related symptom rate was higher (34.5{\%} vs. 19{\%}, p{\textless}0.001). Among the 155 alerts, 146 (94{\%}) were transmitted successfully within 5 minutes. The median interval from 12-lead ECG capture to FHIR notification was 2.7 min [inter-quartile range (IQR) 2.2–3.1 min] for the group with cardiac-related symptoms and 3.0 min (IQR 2.5–3.4 min) for the group with non-cardiac-related symptoms. Conclusion: An automated FHIR-based 12-lead ECG mobile alert system was successfully implemented in an ED.},

abstract = {The traditional databases are not capable of handling unstructured data and high volumes of real-time datasets. Diverse datasets are unstructured lead to big data, and it is laborious to store, manage, process, analyze, visualize, and extract the useful insights from these datasets using traditional database approaches. However, many technical aspects exist in refining large heterogeneous datasets in the trend of big data. This paper aims to present a generalized view of complete big data system which includes several stages and key components of each stage in processing the big data. In particular, we compare and contrast various distributed file systems and MapReduce-supported NoSQL databases concerning certain parameters in data management process. Further, we present distinct distributed/cloud-based machine learning (ML) tools that play a key role to design, develop and deploy data models. The paper investigates case studies on distributed ML tools such as Mahout, Spark MLlib, and FlinkML. Further, we classify analytics based on the type of data, domain, and application. We distinguish various visualization tools pertaining three parameters: functionality, analysis capabilities, and supported development environment. Furthermore, we systematically investigate big data tools and technologies (Hadoop 3.0, Spark 2.3) including distributed/cloud-based stream processing tools in a comparative approach. Moreover, we discuss functionalities of several SQL Query tools on Hadoop based on 10 parameters. Finally, We present some critical points relevant to research directions and opportunities according to the current trend of big data. Investigating infrastructure tools for big data with recent developments provides a better understanding that how different tools and technologies apply to solve real-life applications.},

abstract = {The world population's life expectancy has gradually increased. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the life expectation will reach 90 years by 2030, and this quality of life is one of most important aging aspects. The academic and business communities are devoting many efforts to develop new applications that promote quality of life for this portion of the population; services, such as vital signs monitoring, fall detection systems, heart attacks, among others, are increasingly in evidence. Most of these e-health systems are focused on intelligent devices-Internet of Things (IoT). However, IoT by itself is not able to process, store and guarantee the quality of service of these services due to hardware capacity limitations. So, to mitigate this issue, IoT has two major allies in order to be able to provide e-health services with high availability and quality, fog and cloud computing. This paper presents in progress e-health architecture using IoT for data acquisition, fog for data pre-processing and short-Term storage, and cloud for data processing, analyze and long-Term storage. We also describe main challenges to provide an e-health application with high availability, high performance and accessibility, at low deployment and maintenance cost.},

For that reason it is of interest to well understand how these radio interferences may be influencing a UHF-RFID transceiver working according to EPCglobal Class-1 Gen-2. In particular, in this paper, the combination of interference coming from the self-radio, from other radio systems, such as mobile phone or other RFID reader, is analyzed, and such effects are combined with the appearance of multiple tag antennas interfering each other. A method based on simulation using tag antenna design is presented to evaluate inter-tag interference in a variety of cases. For a better understanding analytic examples are presented to compute such interference interactions within the RFID system. Index Terms-UHF-RFID, mobile phone, read-range, ACPR, IIP3, tag antenna.},

abstract = {This works describes the system LAURA which provides patient localization, tracking and monitoring services within nursing institutes through a wireless sensor network. The system is composed of three functional blocks: a localization and tracking engine which performs localization out of samples of the received signal strength and tracking through a particle filter; a personal monitoring module based on bi-axial accelerometers which classifies the movements of the patients eventually detecting hazardous situations, and a wireless communication infrastructure to deliver the information remotely. The paper comments on the design and dimensioning of the building blocks. Two approaches are proposed to the implementation of the localization and tracking engine: a centralized implementation where localization is executed centrally out of information collected locally, and a distributed solution where the localization is performed at the mobile nodes and the outcome is delivered to the central controller. Strengths and weaknesses of the two solutions are highlighted from a system's perspective in terms of localization accuracy, energy efficiency and traffic loads. LAURA modules are finally tested in a real environment using commercial hardware. The main outcomes are an average localization error lower than 2 m in 80{\%} of the cases and a movements classification accuracy as high as 90{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Wearable medical devices with sensor continuously generate enormous data which is often called as big data mixed with structured and unstructured data. Due to the complexity of the data, it is difficult to process and analyze the big data for finding valuable information that can be useful in decision-making. On the other hand, data security is a key requirement in healthcare big data system. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new architecture for the implementation of IoT to store and process scalable sensor data (big data) for health care applications. The Proposed architecture consists of two main sub architectures, namely, Meta Fog-Redirection (MF-R) and Grouping and Choosing (GC) architecture. MF-R architecture uses big data technologies such as Apache Pig and Apache HBase for collection and storage of the sensor data (big data) generated from different sensor devices. The proposed GC architecture is used for securing integration of fog computing with cloud computing. This architecture also uses key management service and data categorization function (Sensitive, Critical and Normal) for providing security services. The framework also uses MapReduce based prediction model to predict the heart diseases. Performance evaluation parameters such as throughput, sensitivity, accuracy, and f-measure are calculated to prove the efficiency of the proposed architecture as well as the prediction model.},

abstract = {With the growing use of the Robot Operating System (ROS), it can be argued that it has become a de-facto framework for developing robotic solutions. ROS is used to build robotic applications for industrial automation, home automation, medical and even automatic robotic surveillance. However, whenever ROS is utilized, security is one of the main concerns that needs to be addressed in order to ensure a secure network communication of robots. Cyber-attacks may hinder evolution and adaptation of most ROS-enabled robotic systems for real-world use over the Internet. Thus, it is important to address and prevent security threats associated with the use of ROS-enabled applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for securing ROS-enabled robotic system by integrating ROS with the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. We manage to secure robots' network communications by providing authentication and data encryption, therefore preventing man-in-the-middle and hijacking attacks. We also perform real-world experiments to assess how the performance of a ROS-enabled robotic surveillance system is affected by the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Objectives: Heart rate variability (HRV) has gained recognition as a noninvasive marker of autonomic activity. HRV is considered a promising tool in various clinical scenarios. The optimal electrocardiogram (ECG) sampling frequency required to ensure sufficient precision of R–R intervals for HRV analysis has not yet been determined. Here, we aimed to determine the acceptable ECG sampling frequency range by analyzing ECG signals from patients who visited an emergency department with the chief complaint of acute intoxication or overdose. Methods: The study included 83 adult patients who visited an emergency department with the chief complaint of acute poisoning. The original 1,000-Hz ECG signals were down-sampled to 500-, 250-, 100-, and 50-Hz sampling frequencies with linear interpolation. R–R interval data were analyzed for time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear HRV parameters. Parameters derived from the data on down-sampled frequencies were compared with those derived from the data on 1,000-Hz signals, and Lin's concordance correlation coefficients were calculated. Results: Down-sampling to 500 or 250 Hz resulted in excellent concordance. Signals down-sampled to 100 Hz produced acceptable results for time-domain analysis and Poincar{\'{e}} plots, but not for frequency-domain analysis. Down-sampling to 50 Hz proved to be unacceptable for both time-and frequency-domain analyses. At 50 Hz, the root-mean-squared successive differences and the power of high frequency tended to have high values and random errors. Conclusions: A 250-Hz sampling frequency would be acceptable for HRV analysis. When frequency-domain analysis is not required, a 100-Hz sampling frequency would also be acceptable.},

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are playing more and more a key role in several application scenarios such as healthcare, agriculture, environment monitoring, and smart metering. Furthermore, WSNs are characterized by high heterogeneity because there are many different proprietary and non-proprietary solutions. This wide range of technologies has delayed new deployments and integration with existing sensor networks. The current trend, however, is to move away from proprietary and closed standards, to embrace IP-based sensor networks using the emerging standard 6LoWPAN/IPv6. This allows native connectivity between WSN and Internet, enabling smart objects to participate to the Internet of Things (IoT). Building an all-IP infrastructure from scratch, however, would be difficult because many different sensors and actuators technologies (both wired and wireless) have already been deployed over the years. After a review of the state of the art, this paper sketches a framework able to harmonize legacy and new installations, allowing migrating to an all-IP environment at a later stage. The Building Automation use case has been chosen to discuss potential benefits of the proposed framework. {\textcopyright} 2011 University of Split.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is often envisioned as a paradigm shift from the traditional Internet to a scenario where all the “things” will be connected with the Internet. IoT forced the development of novel IoT standards to bring heterogeneous devices and protocols under one umbrella for the seamless interaction between them. To this end, a plethora of IoT standards and definitions have been proposed over the last decade. However, a common consensus over these standards and definitions is yet to be achieved. Another contemporary issue faced by IoT research community is the absence of a clear functional view of different IoT components working together in a cohesive manner to achieve the envisioned “connect everything” phenomena that serve the bigger objective of gathering the information and processing it for better decision making. Information gathering and processing bring the technologies such as “Cloud Computing” and “Big-Data” into the picture with IoT. In the line of energy efficient data processing, “Fog Computing” was introduced a few years back that is one of the key enablers of the contemporary industrial revolution often termed as “Industry 4.0”. However, there is still a need for a detailed study about how “Cloud computing”, “Big data”, and “Fog computing” fit together and act as building blocks of the much envisioned IoT. In this paper, we study the aforementioned issues in the following manner. First, we cover almost every IoT standard and definition available in the literature and propose an unbiased definition of IoT that takes into consideration the key objectives of various research groups. We also discuss the key components of IoT architecture and propose a functional view of IoT based on Weiser's model and information value loop that helps to specify a clear functionality of various IoT enablers. Following this, a detail discussion on information gathering and processing in IoT is supported by state-of-the-art and contemporary technologies such as Cloud computing and Fog computing respectively. We also propose a new perspective of IoT as social processes and a decentralized multi-agent system in order to address not so obvious future challenges that may arise as the research in IoT proceeds and new application domains are discovered. All in all, this survey provides a birds-eye view for the domain as well as introduce intricacies about the IoT functionality, enabling technologies, challenges, future research trends and directions. In the end, this paper discusses the state-of-the-art and contemporary simulations tools that can be used to implement the IoT based projects.

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new communication paradigm that can connect elements from various fields through the Internet. One of the most attractive IoT applications is in the modern healthcare area, as the traditional healthcare system has an increasing demand for social resources, including doctors, nurses, hospital beds, and health monitoring devices. In this article, the design of a compact wearable sensor patch is presented for measurements of different physiological signals, such as the electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and body temperature. As ECG and PPG sensors are integrated with the same device, the proposed sensor patch can be used to estimate blood pressure (BP) continuously based on the pulse arrival time (PAT) without extra wires and devices. The sensor patch consists of a center board for signal acquisition and processing, a power board for energy supply and charging batteries, and three sensors for vital signs monitoring. All the components are designed in a rigid-flex structure, which can be easily attached to the human body for remote health monitoring applications. The sensors can be detached from the center board for customized measurements of a certain physiological signal (e.g., ECG) to reduce power consumption. Experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed sensor patch by comparison with a commercial reference device. With the integration of a miniaturized Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) module, the proposed sensor system can transmit physiological measurements wirelessly to a gateway. Data encryption is applied on both the sensor patch and gateways to protect data for privacy and security purposes during transmission. Both a mobile gateway (based on smartphones) and a fixed gateway (based on portable computers) are designed as the bridge between the wearable sensor system and the Internet cloud, where health data can be stored and further analyzed. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the overall platform for IoT-connected healthcare applications.},

abstract = {In recent years, the continuous development of smart healthcare has brought substantial convenience to our lives, especially for emerging edge-enabled smart healthcare systems that transmit and store a large amount of medical data. However, if private health data of users are leaked or tampered with, it will cause enormous damage to users' rights, even threatening the safety of their lives. Traditionally, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is used to encrypt data and implement fine-grained access control for such sensitive information. However, the computing overhead of traditional ABE is relatively large, and in an edge-enabled environment, the outsourcing part of encryption and decryption to the edge node can reduce the computing cost of resource-constrained devices for edge-enabled smart healthcare. However, current schemes are not efficient for resource-constrained devices and edge nodes. Therefore, an efficient ABE scheme is proposed that outsources part of the encryption and decryption to the edge nodes as well as supports attribute updates, enabling flexible right control. A formal security proof is provided, verifying that our scheme is secure under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption. The performance of our scheme is evaluated at different security levels, and the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is more efficient for resource-constrained devices than the traditional ABE.},

abstract = {Pervasive healthcare services have undergone a great evolution in recent years. The technological development of communication networks, including the Internet, sensor networks, and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) have given rise to new architectures, applications, and standards related to addressing almost all current e-health challenges. Among the standards, the importance of OpenEHR has been recognized, since it enables the separation of medical semantics from data representation of electronic health records. However, it does not meet the requirements related to interoperability of e-health devices in M2M networks, or in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Moreover, the lack of interoperability hampers the application of new data-processing techniques, such as data mining and online analytical processing, due to the heterogeneity of the data and the sources. This article proposes an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform for pervasive healthcare that ensures interoperability, quality of the detection process, and scalability in an M2M-based architecture, and provides functionalities for the processing of high volumes of data, knowledge extraction, and common healthcare services. The platform uses the semantics described in OpenEHR for both data quality evaluation and standardization of healthcare data stored by the association of IoMT devices and observations defined in OpenEHR. Moreover, it enables the application of big data techniques and online analytic processing (OLAP) through Hadoop Map/Reduce and content-sharing through fast healthcare interoperability resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs).},

One of the main areas of research within the Smart City context is smart health, which engages novel IoT initiatives to improve both quality and access to health care and smart services in general. In this paper we present CUIDATS, an IoT hybrid monitoring system for health care environments which integrates RFID and WSN technologies in a single platform providing location, status, and tracking of patients and assets. After its performance validation in a suitable testbed, CUIDATS has been deployed and evaluated with a high degree of success in a real hospital.},

abstract = {Background and objective To take full advantage of decision support, machine learning, and patient-level prediction models, it is important that models are not only created, but also deployed in a clinical setting. The KETOS platform demonstrated in this work implements a tool for researchers allowing them to perform statistical analyses and deploy resulting models in a secure environment. Methods The proposed system uses Docker virtualization to provide researchers with reproducible data analysis and development environments, accessible via Jupyter Notebook, to perform statistical analysis and develop, train and deploy models based on standardized input data. The platform is built in a modular fashion and interfaces with web services using the Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to access patient data. In our prototypical implementation we use an OMOP common data model (OMOP-CDM) database. The architecture supports the entire research lifecycle from creating a data analysis environment, retrieving data, and training to final deployment in a hospital setting. Results We evaluated the platform by establishing and deploying an analysis and end user application for hemoglobin reference intervals within the University Hospital Erlangen. To demonstrate the potential of the system to deploy arbitrary models, we loaded a colorectal cancer dataset into an OMOP database and built machine learning models to predict patient outcomes and made them available via a web service. We demonstrated both the integration with FHIR as well as an example end user application. Finally, we integrated the platform with the open source DataSHIELD architecture to allow for distributed privacy preserving data analysis and training across networks of hospitals. Conclusion The KETOS platform takes a novel approach to data analysis, training and deploying decision support models in a hospital or healthcare setting. It does so in a secure and privacy-preserving manner, combining the flexibility of Docker virtualization with the advantages of standardized vocabularies, a widely applied database schema (OMOP-CDM), and a standardized way to exchange medical data (FHIR).},

abstract = {We have developed an interface to serve patient data from Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) repositories in the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format, referred to as a SMART-on-FHIR cell. The cell serves FHIR resources on a per-patient basis, and supports the "substitutable" modular third-party applications (SMART) OAuth2 specification for authorization of client applications. It is implemented as an i2b2 server plug-in, consisting of 6 modules: authentication, REST, i2b2-to-FHIR converter, resource enrichment, query engine, and cache. The source code is freely available as open source. We tested the cell by accessing resources from a test i2b2 installation, demonstrating that a SMART app can be launched from the cell that accesses patient data stored in i2b2. We successfully retrieved demographics, medications, labs, and diagnoses for test patients. The SMART-on-FHIR cell will enable i2b2 sites to provide simplified but secure data access in FHIR format, and will spur innovation and interoperability. Further, it transforms i2b2 into an apps platform.},

abstract = {Background: Standards-based clinical data normalization has become a key component of effective data integration and accurate phenotyping for secondary use of electronic healthcare records (EHR) data. HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is an emerging clinical data standard for exchanging electronic healthcare data and has been used in modeling and integrating both structured and unstructured EHR data for a variety of clinical research applications. The overall objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework for identification of patients with obesity and its multiple comorbidities from semi-structured discharge summaries leveraging a FHIR-based clinical data normalization pipeline (known as NLP2FHIR). Methods: We implemented a multi-class and multi-label classification system based on the i2b2 Obesity Challenge task to evaluate the FHIR-based EHR phenotyping framework. Two core parts of the framework are: (a) the conversion of discharge summaries into corresponding FHIR resources – Composition, Condition, MedicationStatement, Procedure and FamilyMemberHistory using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, and (b) the implementation of four machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and random forest) to train classifiers to predict disease state of obesity and 15 comorbidities using features extracted from standard FHIR resources and terminology expansions. We used the macro- and micro-averaged precision (P), recall (R), and F1 score (F1) measures to evaluate the classifier performance. We validated the framework using a second obesity dataset extracted from the MIMIC-III database. Results: Using the NLP2FHIR pipeline, 1237 clinical discharge summaries from the 2008 i2b2 obesity challenge dataset were represented as the instances of the FHIR Composition resource consisting of 5677 records with 16 unique section types. After the NLP processing and FHIR modeling, a set of 244,438 FHIR clinical resource instances were generated. As the results of the four machine learning classifiers, the random forest algorithm performed the best with F1-micro(0.9466)/F1-macro(0.7887) and F1-micro(0.9536)/F1-macro(0.6524) for intuitive classification (reflecting medical professionals' judgments) and textual classification (reflecting the judgments based on explicitly reported information of diseases), respectively. The MIMIC-III obesity dataset was successfully integrated for prediction with minimal configuration of the NLP2FHIR pipeline and machine learning models. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that the FHIR-based EHR phenotyping approach could effectively identify the state of obesity and multiple comorbidities using semi-structured discharge summaries. Our FHIR-based phenotyping approach is a first concrete step towards improving the data aspect of phenotyping portability across EHR systems and enhancing interpretability of the machine learning-based phenotyping algorithms.},

@article{Choi2016,
abstract = {Leveraging large historical data in electronic health record (EHR), we developed Doctor AI, a generic predictive model that covers observed medical conditions and medication uses. Doctor AI is a temporal model using recurrent neural networks (RNN) and was developed and applied to longitudinal time stamped EHR data from 260K patients over 8 years. Encounter records (e.g. diagnosis codes, medication codes or procedure codes) were input to RNN to predict (all) the diagnosis and medication categories for a subsequent visit. Doctor AI assesses the history of patients to make multilabel predictions (one label for each diagnosis or medication category). Based on separate blind test set evaluation, Doctor AI can perform differential diagnosis with up to 79{\%} recall@30, significantly higher than several baselines. Moreover, we demonstrate great generalizability of Doctor AI by adapting the resulting models from one institution to another without losing substantial accuracy.},

The suggested architecture aims at distributing the workload of system performance (electronic healthcare services), including monitoring, diagnosis, prediction, as well as managing and archiving medical data of patients across different points of the system (at the edge and on the cloud). The proposed system design consists of two main subsystems (one for monitoring tasks and another one for medical record management activities). Both subsystems interact with multiple kinds of database systems (SQL and NoSQL). Transformational-based system for data migration is presented as a contribution of this paper. Two styles of transformation compositions are considered in the architectural design of transformation agents.},

abstract = {The rapid development of Internet of things (IoT) technology makes it possible for connecting various smart objects together through the Internet and providing more data interoperability methods for application purpose. Recent research shows more potential applications of IoT in information intensive industrial sectors such as healthcare services. However, the diversity of the objects in IoT causes the heterogeneity problem of the data format in IoT platform. Meanwhile, the use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model is proposed to store and interpret IoT data. Then a resource-based data accessing method (UDA-IoT) is designed to acquire and process IoT data ubiquitously to improve the accessibility to IoT data resources. Finally, we present an IoT-based system for emergency medical services to demonstrate how to collect, integrate, and interoperate IoT data flexibly in order to provide support to emergency medical services. The result shows that the resource-based IoT data accessing method is effective in a distributed heterogeneous data environment for supporting data accessing timely and ubiquitously in a cloud and mobile computing platform. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},
