\noindent

In the past years, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have observed the continuous digital transformation of healthcare. But there is one technology in particular that shows potential to revolutionize the current healthcare paradigm -- the \acf{IoT}. 

This work focuses on the development of a secure Internet of Things infrastructure which connects wireless, wearable, and intelligent sensors to a health information system used by multiple national hospitals. In particular, an extensive benchmarking of common IoT hardware platforms to serve as \acs{IoT} acquisition nodes is performed, and an analysis of \acf{BLE} communication protocol to evaluate the adequacy of the devices used to implement it. Additionally, a specification for \acf{MQTT} communication is also proposed, as well as the development of an \acf{API} using \acf{FHIR}, an open standard widely used in health informatics for exchanging electronic health records, to integrate the IoT infrastructure with the health information system, coupled with an efficient service architecture for the edge server, designed with security and privacy in mind. 

The work is validated both through trials within hospital facilities and controlled laboratory tests, in which the infrastructure shows efficient resource usage, maximum availability and security, providing solid foundations for future work to build upon.
