\noindent

In the past years, particularly with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have observed the continuous digital transformation of healthcare. One technology in particular shows potential to revolutionize the current healthcare paradigm -- the \acf{IoT}.

This work focuses on the development of an \acs{IoT} infrastructure which connects wireless intelligent sensors to a health information system (\acs{HIS}) used by multiple national hospitals. In particular, an extensive benchmarking of common \acs{IoT} hardware platforms to serve as \acs{IoT} acquisition nodes is performed, and an analysis of \acf{BLE} communication. A specification for \acf{MQTT} communication is proposed, as well as the development of a \acf{FHIR} \acf{API} to integrate the \acs{IoT} infrastructure with the \acs{HIS}, coupled with an efficient service architecture for the \textit{edge} server, designed with security and privacy in mind.

The work is validated both through hospital trials and controlled lab tests, in which the infrastructure shows efficient resource usage, maximum availability and security, providing solid foundations for future work to build upon.
