After developing and analyzing the different \acs{IoT} system components, it is time to evaluate its overall performance in a real-world scenario. In this chapter, the results of the hospital trial are presented and discussed. 

\section{Hospital Pilot}

For the hospital trial, the proposed \acs{IoT} system was deployed in an clinical facility within Centro Hospitalar e Universit√°rio de Coimbra (CHUC), during which two volunteers were continuously monitoring using the system.

\end{figure}
\dots

To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, the following performance indicators were defined and measured throughout the tests:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Average \acs{MQTT} Bandwidth over time;
    \item Average \acs{FHIR} Bandwidth;
    \item Average CPU and RAM usage of each service;
\end{itemize}

In the next section, 8 hours of the monitorization are analyzed and presented.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter, the performance of the proposed system during the hospital trial was tested and discussed. 
In the next, and final chapter, an overview of the work achieved is presented in light of the proposed contributions, concluding with some final remarks.
